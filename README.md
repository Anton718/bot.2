# bot.2
This is a TELEGRAM bot. Some of us have been on a dating app at least for a while, and sometimes it takes so much time replying to everyone same basic questions trying to identify whether this person is your type or not. So why not to address them to this telegram bot and let the bot decide whether you should move on with the candidate or not.
The bot will ask which country the candidate is from, their age, built, maybe they send you their picture and you automatically reply with yours. And then if the candidate gets enough points from answering questions, their status will be set as {isCandidate: true}, which means you can find them by username and confirm their interest. If points are not enough, the status will be set as {isCandidate: false}.
